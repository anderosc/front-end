    <h2>Memory Game</h2>
    <p id="p"> This memory game is a memory challenge where players repeat an ever-growing
         sequence of lights and sounds. The game starts with one button lighting up,
          and the player must press the same button. Each round, Simon adds another 
          step to the sequence, which the player must replicate in order. The game 
          continues until the player makes a mistake, and the score reflects the number 
          of correctly repeated steps.
