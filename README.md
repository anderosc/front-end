Each folder in my GitHub repository represents a different project where Iâ€™ve experimented with displaying elements and manipulating data, 
along with other key front-end functionalities like user interactions and state management. The projects showcase various techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The most recent project is a webshop, which includes most of the essential elements typically found in an e-commerce site, such as product listings, 
cart functionality, and user authentication etc.
